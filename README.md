# Docker Stacks of Quantum Computing
Docker images of Quantum Computing frameworks with Jupyter notebooks

* [qiskit-notebook](qiskit-notebook): IBM Qiskit with visualization package
* [qsharp-notebook](qsharp-notebook): Microsoft Q# and QDK with `matplotlib` and `pytest`
* [cirq-notebook](cirq-notebook): Google Cirq with contrib packages

All the docker images are based on [`jupyter/base-notebook`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/base-notebook).
Therefore, we can take advantage of the convenient features of [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
